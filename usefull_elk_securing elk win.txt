Securing kibana in windows
---------------------------
Ref: https://www.elastic.co/blog/getting-started-with-elasticsearch-security

*Step 1: Create two Elasticsearch nodes
Make two copies of the Elasticsearch directory, one named elasticsearch-master one named elasticsearch-node

*step 2: Configure TLS and authentication
- The first thing we have to do is generate some certificates that allow the nodes to communicate securely. You can do this with an enterprise CA, 
but for this demo, we have a command called elasticsearch-certutil that will help us in the generation of X.509 certificates and certificate.
> cd elasticsearch-master
> bin\elasticsearch-certutil cert -out config\elastic-certificates.p12 -pass ""

Certificates written to c:\elasticsearch-master\config\elastic-certificates.p12
This file should be properly secured as it contains the private key for
your instance.

- Next, open up the file config/elasticsearch.yaml in your favorite text editor. Paste the lines below at the end of the file. 
"
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12

You need to set also the cluster name in the elasticsearch.yml file, since it is compulsory to get data nodes in place for the .security index to get created. 
With the default config of elasticsearch the data node is not created on startup.
"
cluster.name: secured-cluster
"
- start the master node
> bin\elasticsearch.bat

We can observe that the certificate exception is not showing up again.

*Step 3: Setup Elasticsearch cluster passwords
First the master elasticsearch instance most be running. Then open a new console.
> cd elasticsearch-master
>bin\elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto #or "interactive" to enter namually your password

Changed password for user apm_system
PASSWORD apm_system = 0prrgVTVA3UswlQWDN0U
Changed password for user kibana
PASSWORD kibana = nIJRIo2hWtRRbiSPV8bB
Changed password for user logstash_system
PASSWORD logstash_system = fiGDPsbGUA2EPEX2Egab
Changed password for user beats_system
PASSWORD beats_system = 3U6FZMisxNmvw2jlhrZQ
Changed password for user remote_monitoring_user
PASSWORD remote_monitoring_user = rNrC31nsUvbQSq2I9ZJ7
Changed password for user elastic
PASSWORD elastic = TuTVGF5GDvWvzUCSbetq

*step4: Setup a TLS on Elasticsearch node
!! this is used to join a new node to the existing one.

*step5: Setup Security in Kibana
We’ll need to add the password for the Kibana user. We can grab that from the previous output of the setup-passwords command.
In the config/kibana.yml file, edit the following line to "user" to "kibana" and then change "pass" to whatever the setup-passwords command tells us the Kibana password is
"
elasticsearch.username: "kibana"
elasticsearch.password: "nIJRIo2hWtRRbiSPV8bB"
"
Then run kibana
>bin\kibana.bat

*step5: Configure role-based access control (RBAC) within Kibana
Once Kibana is running we can switch over to our web browser and open http://localhost:5601. It’s going to ask us for a login, 
we’ll use the elastic superuser with the password from setup-passwords. !!! Not the kibana user and password, if we log with this one, it will give access limited page
#########################
user: elastic
password: TuTVGF5GDvWvzUCSbetq 
#########################
For the first time Kibana ast us if we want to load sample data. let us load "sample fligt data"

- Now let’s create our roles. Find and click on the roles option. 
Go to Management(gear)> Security section > Roles > Create role. 
Then enter 
- the Role name
- Set the index privileges: by defining the indices (Table to read) and the privileges (operation authorized to perform).

Then create a user
- Enter username and password. email and fullname is not compulsory.
- In the roles field: assign the created role +"Kibana_user". We need to assign the kibana_user role as this user will be viewing data in Kibana.
"kibana_dashboard_only_user": Roles that belong to View Dashboards Only mode

-Now logout as elastic and login with the user account created. The user can see any dashboard name in the list but when displaying the data they can see anything.
